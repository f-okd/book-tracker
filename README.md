- Yet to come up with a name

#### Libraries
- Vite: Build tool
- Vitest: Test runner
- Testing library: Used to test react components
- JSDOM: lets us do dom like things without a web browser, and we need a dom environment to test react components in isolation, because the expectations that come with vitest aren't sufficient for testing-library
- Eslint + Prettier: Code formatters that work in tandem, eslint extends prettier so I can specify code standards, and have my code auto-formatted on save.
- React-router: Used to manage client side routing, and enables SPA feature of navigating between pages without reloading.
- Tailwind: Styling, MUI was also a good choice and would probably be faster for development but I prefer the increased control over component styling provided with TW
